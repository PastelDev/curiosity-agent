# Synthesized NPCs and Factions for Aurathia (from Tournament)

## Overview
10-12 Iconic NPCs (heroes, villains, ambiguous) and 6 Factions perfectly fitting magical industrial revolution with Aetherblight corruption (crystalline-void miasma from overharvesting ley lines).

**Key Factions**:
- Iron Arcane Guild (industrialists, villains like Harlan Grimshaw)
- Blightborn Covenant (corrupt cult, Vesper Noct)
- Workers' Union (revolutionaries, Elara Voss, Mira Awakened golem)
- Verdant Collective (solarpunk druids, Lirael Sunweaver)
- Skyfarers (airship pirates/smugglers, Jax Rourke)
- Sunspire Puritans (tech purists)

**Sample NPCs**:
- **Elara Voss** (Hero Tinkerer, CG, Workers' Union): Plasma-arm inventor fighting guild monopolies.
- **Harlan Grimshaw** (Villain Baron, LE, Iron Guild): Blight-experimenting noble.
- **Vesper Noct** (Villain Prophet, CE, Blightborn): Preaches embracing corruption.
- Ambiguous: Elowen Flux (polymath inventor), Zarael Broker (merchant).

Interconnections: Factions feud over progress vs purity vs embrace; NPCs lead/tie across (e.g., guild sponsors puritans, cult infiltrates union). RPG stubs, quirks, plot hooks included.

Full details in tournament files. Ties to plot hooks/tech (e.g., blight from apex tech).
