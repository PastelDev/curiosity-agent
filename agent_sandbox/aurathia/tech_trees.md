# Aurathia Magical Technology Trees (Synthesized from Tournament)

## Overview
Aurathia's magical industrial revolution is powered by 4 interconnected tech trees blending 1800-1900s industry (steam, rails, factories, automation) with solarpunk magic (sun-mana, living vines, regenerative harmony). Progress through 4 tiers: Prototypes (T1), Workshop Scale (T2), Industrial Deployment (T3), Apex Innovation (T4). Each has key inventions, artificer roles, corruption risks (escalating shadow bleed).

Interconnections: Solar Engines power everything; Automata build/maintain; Rails transport; Verdant produces materials.

### 1. Solar Arcana Engines (Power)
- T1: Sun Ember Lenses, Mana Boilers (Lenswrights).
- T2: Crystal Dynamo Webs (Dynamo Spinmasters).
- T3: Helios Mirror Arrays (Mirror Architects).
- T4: Eclipse Reactors (Eclipse Wardens).
- Risks: Flares -> Umbral entities.

### 2. Mana-Forged Automata (Automation)
- T1: Vine Looms, Mana Seed Cores (Vinebinders).
- T2: Golem Workers, Modular Limbs (Golemshapers).
- T3: Swarm Hives, Factory Titans (Hive Queens).
- T4: Synthient Nexus (Mindweavers).
- Risks: Berserk -> Uprising nanites.

### 3. Aether Rail Networks (Transport)
- T1: Mana-Wind Carts (Runesmiths).
- T2: Solar Locomotives (Sailweavers).
- T3: Levitrain Mag-Lev (Coilwinders).
- T4: Voidgate Portals (Gateforgers).
- Risks: Storms -> Shadow abductions.

### 4. Verdant Alchemy Networks (Production)
- T1: Sunbloom Greenhouses (Greenhouse Wardens).
- T2: Mycelium Forges (Mycologists).
- T3: Arborfactories (Arbor Surgeons).
- T4: Gaia Symbiotes (Seed Sowers).
- Risks: Traps -> Fungal terraform.

Guilds: Forgekin Collective, Aetherway Consortium, Verdant Alchemists Guild.

Full details in tournament files. Risks tie to corruption lurking in dark.
