All subtasks complete with 3+ iterations each (world_synthesis_v3.md master core, then locations_v3, races_v3, mechanics_v3 w/Python sim, npcs_v3, campaigns_v3). Tournament_2bd99ceeefb1 full (3 rounds, final synthesis files integrated: Solara naming, UD probs, epilogues). Files hyper-detailed: tables/maps/stats/hooks/monsters/plots/edges/balance. Diverse (races/NPCs/factions), strategic (Flux/EP/UD positioning/risk), solarpunk magitech (crystals/vines uncertain mana). DnD 5.5e ready campaigns 1-20. Excellence: No gaps/missing (history/locs/races/NPCs/mech/char opt/campaigns all exceeded). Ready for complete_task.
