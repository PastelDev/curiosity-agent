Create a dnd-style rpg world. Late high fantasy, with solarpunk magical-technological revolution in a big city or some big cities, to show how the world would focus on magic rather than pure science to create technology, bacause its difficult to understand the difference, but magic is a bit more uncertain sometimes. The world should be diverse, and very very detailed. Make sure you completely highlight the details of every important location, every piece of history, every important NPC, and even create character options and game mechanics inspired by dnd 5.5e, but more creative and strategical. Even create campaigns. Make sure you create everything you can imagine that is related before you stop. Use agents to research for ideas, others to do tournaments and get powerful insights. Good luck!
